make a website that we will provide to hospitals for online management of their paperwork
the home page will have about us, contact us, specialities that we offer, new registration, Patient Login and Doctor Login
after new registration- the patient will have to fill in his/her details(like height, weight, bmi,etc.) after undergoing a checkup at our hospital
in patient login he will be able to see his current treatment plan, upcoming appointments, Lab and test reports, profile (he can see his height, weight, bmi,etc.), 
	consulted doctors and his medicine course along with some positive quotes
in Doctor login he will able to see the current condition of admitted patients that would be linked to/ updated by the nurse or wardboy
	he can see his upcoming appointments and personalized view of his patients health records
after registering, the person's medical history in comapct form will be visible to the hospital that is accessing it
	this will be done by assigning a unique code to every individual and storing their medical histroy in that code on a central government server
	this can be accessed only by those hospitals that are registered under government at only at the time of emergency like blood loss,etc.
	so that we do not waste time in regular checkups and can immediately start treatment according to the medical history of the patient
