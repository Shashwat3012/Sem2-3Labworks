Project Abstract-
	E-Healthcare System is a system(website) that we will create which would optimize the process of monitoring
and treating the patients and would help the doctors monitor the health conditions of patients remotely. We could
also use this for keeping record of the patients medical history in a central government server which can be accessed
by a hospital at times of medical emergency to fasten up the process. This website can also help in suggesting treatment
plans to patient and for booking an appointment with the concerned doctor.
